		If a creature would enter under an opponent’s control and wasn’t cast from their hand, exile it instead. If it didn’t come from their reserves, they create a token that’s a copy of it there. <i-auto>(As long as Elias holds them hostage, they can’t enter. Once he leaves they may pay <sym>3</sym> as a sorcery to put up to three of them onto the battlefield.)</i-auto>
