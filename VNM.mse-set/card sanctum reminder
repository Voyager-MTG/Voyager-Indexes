		Before the game starts, place your sanctum here face down. <u><b>This is not an ordered deck</b></u>. You can look at your sanctum at any time.
		Your sanctum consists of up to seven basic land cards and unique nonbasic cards that can start in the sanctum.
		You can move cards in and out of your sanctum in <error-spelling:en_US:/magic.mse-game/dictionary/magic-words>sideboarding</error-spelling:en_US:/magic.mse-game/dictionary/magic-words>, provided that all the cards in it can start there.
