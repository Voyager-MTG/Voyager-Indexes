		If <atom-cardname><nospellcheck>Abstracter of Thought</nospellcheck></atom-cardname> would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, shuffle it into its owner’s library instead.
		If you would draw a card while your library has no cards in it, you may instead return a card from your graveyard to your hand.
