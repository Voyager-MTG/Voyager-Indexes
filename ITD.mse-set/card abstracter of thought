	rule_text:
		If <atom-cardname><nospellcheck>this creature</nospellcheck></atom-cardname> would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, shuffle it into its owner’s library instead.
		Once each turn, if you would draw a card while your library has no cards in it, you may instead exile a card from your graveyard. If it’s a nonland card, you may cast a copy of that card without paying its mana cost.
